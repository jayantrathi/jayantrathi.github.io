Technologies: Python & ML Concepts (TensorFlow/Keras/SVMs), OpenCV, Firebase, GPS, Embedded ML, ROS concepts

A fully integrated multi-modal security robot that processes vision, sound, and motion sensors simultaneously:
	•	Engineered three real-time AI models:
	•	Face recognition (OpenCV + Haar/CNN pipeline)
	•	Dangerous-sound classifier (TensorFlow/Keras, MFCC preprocessing, SVM Model Final build) Built a Yamnet based realtime sound-classification pipeline achieving 97% accuracy on a set of hazards (fires, screams, breaking objects, body falling, glass breaking).
	•	Motion detection + region tracking
	•	Developed GPS-based movement and automated patrol logic.
	•	Implemented a Firebase real-time cloud alert system sending messages to a LINE app notification channel.
	•	Worked as part of a 2-member R&D team, then presented the system as the only student researcher at a professional engineering conference (EECON 46) representing the university alongside the dean.

This project shows real-world embedded AI development, dataset creation, model deployment, and cross-modal perception integration.
