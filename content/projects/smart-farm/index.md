Technologies: ESP32, Firebase, Node-RED, Android/Blynk, MATLAB Simulink, PLC logic

A cloud-connected mobile control system for agriculture automation:

•	Designed an IoT architecture where the ESP32 acted as the hardware control layer, communicating with a Firebase database.

•	Built a mobile interface using Android Studio/Blynk for remote irrigation/fertilizer control.

•	Developed data flow pipelines through Node-RED dashboards for system visualization.

•	Simulated physical irrigation hardware using MATLAB/Simulink and PLC logic to validate timing, actuation, and fault behavior before deployment.

•	Coordinated sensor reading, actuator timing, and error reporting for consistent field behavior.
