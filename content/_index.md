      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        Professionally, I am a Robotics Engineer who builds intelligent systems end-to-end, combining robotics, automation, and machine learning into           practical, deployed solutions. I love complex and real world problems and eventually seeing their solutions have positive effects on the                 people around me.

        Personally, I'm a Indian born in Thailand, whose grown up in Sri Lanka and is currently in Boston. Having changed 7 schools by the time I was           in 5th grade I've developed a knack for adaptability and finding comfort in the uncomfortable and I take that approach towards most                      of what I do.
