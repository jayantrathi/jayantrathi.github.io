      title: 'About Me '
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
       I am a robotics and AI engineer with a life shaped by motion, on the road, in the gym, and across the world. My passions stretch from F1, tennis, boxing, and strength training to cooking and exploring new cultures, each adding its own layer to how I think and work. I’ve traveled widely, and that perspective shows up in the way I solve problems: fast, adaptable, and grounded in real-world context. Professionally, I build intelligent systems end-to-end, combining robotics, automation, and machine learning into practical, deployed solutions. Altogether, I’m someone who moves with intention whether I’m designing a system, learning a new skill, or navigating a new city.
