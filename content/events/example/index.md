summary: An example talk using Hugo Blox Builder's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: As the sole student presenter at a professional-majority conference representing my university, I showcased the development and deployement of a fully integrated home-security robot that merged real-time facial recognition, audio hazard detection through real time clasification, motion tracking, and cloud-based alerts. Deployed on embedded hardware and orchestrated with ROS2 navigation, the system processed multiple forms of data and achieved 97% accuracy on hazardous acoustic events. Live demos captured autonomous patrols and instant homeowner notifications via Firebase. The results validated how a compact, agile robot can fill a critical gap in residential safety—and positioned my work as a serious contributor in both academic and industrial robotics engineering.
