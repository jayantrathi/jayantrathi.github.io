abstract: |
  This paper presents the research and implimentation of a multi-modal AI based home security robot integrating facial recognition, audio hazard detection, motion tracking, and cloud-linked notification modules. I was told to try and write the paper for review of the publication by my dean at the time of my final project presentation and was able to help represent my university with this submission and its eventual callup for a conference.
  The system described within utilizes machine learning pipelines deployed
  on embedded hardware to process real-time sensory data, achieving high
  accuracy in detecting dangerous acoustic events such as screams, drops, breaking and other human danger related sounds. 
  The paper is a look into a system like this and its feasibility through adoption into residential homes to help with issues like elder care and child care while the adults are away, or even a glimps into the concept of warehouse security through a network of systems like so. 

summary: |
  A paper on the research behind a multi-modal AI-based home security robot combining facial recognition,
  audio classification, motion detection, and cloud alerts. Presented at EECON 46.
