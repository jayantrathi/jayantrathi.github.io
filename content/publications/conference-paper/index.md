abstract: |
  This paper presents the research and implimentation of a multi-modal intelligent       home security system integrating facial recognition, audio hazard detection, motion    tracking, and cloud-linked notification modules. The system utilizes machine           learning pipelines deployed
  on embedded hardware to process real-time sensory data, achieving high
  accuracy in detecting dangerous acoustic events such as screams, drops,
  and fire-related sounds. The project demonstrates the feasibility of a
  low-cost, real-time home-security platform suitable for residential and
  small-scale commercial use.

summary: |
  A multi-modal AI-based home security robot combining facial recognition,
  audio classification, motion detection, and cloud alerts. Presented at EECON 46.
